#fiverrMockup

Hi, this time I tried to mock up Fiverr website, again to practice my scss skills. The language really helps organise code. Please browse my project at:
https://tony-sn.github.io/fiverrMockup/

Certainly I do not have time to fulfill all the elements that the real site shows, merely some main features, as I just want to focus on SCSS for this project.

Please feel free to observe my code, or see for yourself at fiverr.com

Peace,

Tony Nguyen
